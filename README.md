# hello-world
My first GitHub project!
Hi! My name is Caleb, and I am venturing into the exciting world of github in an attempt to extend my (very) basic programing and game design knowledge into something i can use to make professional quality projects, and join a community of talented designers and programmers to make new friends and help myself grow into the more well-rounded, talented, and professional person i aspire to be. I currently work in the retail field, at a grocery store, as a front end manager, but would eventually like to make my way into a more technical field. I would love to make indie games eventually, as I have a creative personality and would love to bring my visions for the kind of games i would like to play to life. I am also an amateur-hobbyist musician who has played in several bands over the years, and had a great time doing it. I would like to eventually score soundtracks for indie games. I really enjoy music, tacos, pizza, micro-brews, wine, video games, art, friends, and family. I'm looking forward to meeting you! Sincerely, Caleb
